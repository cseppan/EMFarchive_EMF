"Code","Description"
"B","Tribal data"
"L","Local agency data"
"M","MACT and 112(k) Area Source data"
"P","Preferred MACT/Area Source data"
"R","Regional Planning Organization data"
"S","State agency data"
"T","2002 Toxics Release Inventory data"
"767/CAMD","Record in both 2002 Form EIA-767 and 2002 Emission tracking system/continuous emissions monitoring (ETS/CEM); with SO2, NOx, and heat input values from ETS/CEM; condensible PM, and primary PM10 and PM2.5 are recalculated using CAMD heat input values."
"CAMD","Record only in 2002 ETS/CEM for SO2, NOx, and heat input values; other emissions estimated."
"767/CAMD1","Combined cycle record (heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) + combustion turbine) in 2002 ETS/CEM used; the HRSG record in 2002 Form EIA-767 eliminated.  SO2, NOx, and heat input values from ETS/CEM; other emissions estimated."
"767/CAMD2","Combined cycle record (steam turbine + combustion turbine) in 2002 ETS/CEM used; the steam record in 2002 Form EIA-767 eliminated.  SO2, NOx, and heat input values from ETS/CEM; other emissions estimated."
"A","Augmented PM Data"
"I","Industry"
"N","Data is from an earlier NEI Inventory."
"BCAMD1","Data were received from the tribal agency.  The tribal agency’s NOX and SO2 emission values were replaced with the ETS values."
"CAMD1","Data was not received from the state, local agency, or tribal agency.  The ETS records were used."
"LCAMD1","Data were received from the local agency.  The local agency’s NOX and SO2 emission values were replaced with the ETS values."
"LCAMD3","Data were received from the local agency.  The local agency’s NOX and SO2 value was used where the ETS value was zero."
"PCAMDHG","No data were received from the state.  The ESD mercury values were given to the ETS record."
"PLHG","Data were received from the local agency.  The local agency provided a total mercury record.  The record was replaced with three individual mercury species records from ESD."
"PSHG","Data were received from the state.  The state provided a total mercury record.  The record was replaced with three individual mercury species records from ESD."
"SCAMD1","Data were received from the state.  The state’s NOX and SO2 emission values were replaced with the ETS values."
"SCAMD2","Data were received from the state.  The state did not provide NOX, SO2, or either.  NOX and/or SO2 records were created with the same IDs and the ETS values were used."
"SCAMD3","Data were received from the state.  The state’s NOX and SO2 value was used where the ETS value was zero."
"SCAMD4","Data were received from the state.  It was not clear which of the state’s units matched to the ETS units.  The state values were maintained, because the emissions were close to the ETS values."
"PI","Preferred industry data."
"767","Estimates based on 2002 Form EIA-767 Information."
"C-01-F","Wyoming did not have any PM and NOX data in their submittal.  Data was brought forward from the 2001 inventory."
"A-R","Augmented PM data replaced existing PM data submitted to NEI"
"A-C","Augmented Chromium Data"
"A-B","Augmented Boiler Data"
