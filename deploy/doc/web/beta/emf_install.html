		<h2 id="permissions">Set Directory Permissions</h2>
		<div class="section">
			<p>For the EMF server to properly import and export datasets and interact with SMOKE, 
			the "emf" user (the UNIX username that is the owner of the tomcat process), the "postgres" 
			user, and the SMOKE user will at times need to read and/or write to the same directories. 
			To facilitate these shared permissions, we previously setup an "emiss" group for all three 
			user types. Now we will setup a series of directories with the proper permissions so that 
			the EMF can import and export datasets successfully. The following directories are just 
			examples, so feel free to use your own directory structure. What is important is that the 
			directory structure has the correct permissions and that the discs that are mounted on both 
			the EMFServer and the SMOKEServer use the same names. For example, if a disc is mounted on 
			the EMFServer at <span class="pre">/data2</span>, it should also be mounted on the SMOKEServer 
			at <span class="pre">/data2</span>. Although these have been broken into different root 
			directories, many of these directories could be on the same disc or could be sub-directories 
			of the same root directory. 
			</p>
			<p>The purpose of this step is to figure out the directories on your system that correspond to 
			the example directories listed below and change the permissions as described in the list:
				<ul>
					<li><span class="pre">/data2/tmp</span> -- Temporary directory for postgres to write 
					inventory data files. This should have at least a couple of gigabytes for moving 
					more than one inventory in and out of the database. Due to a "feature" of 
					postgres, the "emiss" group needs 'rwx' permissions all the way to the top of this 
					directory structure. If you choose <span class="pre">/tmp</span>, you will not need 
					to modify the permissions of this directory. In our example, both <span class="pre">/data2</span> 
					and <span class="pre">/data2/tmp</span> would have their permissions set to 'rwx' for 
					the "emiss" group.					
					</li>
					<li><span class="pre">/data3/imports/inventories</span> -- Location of the inventories 
					that you will import into the EMF database. This directory should have 'rx' 
					permissions for the "emiss" group. You do not need to have a single location for all 
					imports, but you should make sure that your EMF users know a general location (that 
					could have many sub-directories) with the proper group permissions.
					</li>
					<li><span class="pre">/data4/smoke/.../inputs</span> -- Location of the inputs for 
					SMOKE and the location where the EMF will create sub-directories and export inventories 
					and ancillary files. This should have 'rwx' permissions for the "emiss" group. This 
					is primarily so the "emf" user can create directories for you as needed during export 
					of inventories from the EMF.
					</li>
					<li><span class="pre">/data4/smoke/.../smoke_out</span> -- Location of the model-ready 
					emissions output from SMOKE. This directory (and all of the sub-directories) could 
					be 'rwx' permissions for the "emiss" group. The EMF server only needs to read from 
					these directories, but the SMOKE user also needs to write to this directory structure.
					</li>
					<li><span class="pre">/data4/smoke/.../reports</span> &#8211; Same as for the "smoke_out" 
					directory, above.
					</li>

		<h2 id="database">Load EMF Database</h2>
		<div class="section">
			<h4>Complete the following steps:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Download and untar <a href="ftp://ftp.unc.edu/pub/empd/azubrow/emf_installation_beta.tar.gz">the emf_installation_beta tar file</a>. This can be untarred 
						anywhere. For my example, you can put it in your home directory:
						
							<div class="pre">$ cp emf_installation_beta.tar.gz ~/</div>
							<div class="pre">$ tar xvzf emf_installation_beta.tar.gz</div>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Under <span class="pre">~/emf_installation_beta/db</span>, edit the script <em>SetupEMFDatabase.sh</em>. Modify the two settings shown below to indicate 
						(a) the path to the setup script and (b) the root directory for Postgres:
				
							<div class="pre">export PSQLSCRIPTSDIR=/home/azubrow/emf_installation_beta/db</div>
							<div class="pre">export POSTGRESDIR=/usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3</div>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Double check that the Postgres server is running with the command shown here:
							<div class="pre">$ ps aux| grep postgres</div>
						</p>
						<p>If it is not running, start the server (see <a href="./third_party_install.html#postgres">Postgres Details</a> from Part 1).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Run the setup script. Note: This will create a new PostgreSQL user "emf" and a new
						database &#8220;EMF&#8221;. The script will ask you twice for a password for the new
						role, the emf user (database user). <b>This password must be "emf"</b>. To reduce the
						number of times that you type in the password, change the login permission requirements
						for the postgres server (see <a href="./third_party_install.html#postgres">Postgres Post-Installation Configuration</a>). Redirect the output to a log file:
							<div class="pre">$ ./SetupEMFDatabase.sh &gt;&amp; log.setup</div>
						</p>
						<p>Check for errors in the log (i.e., log.setup in the example here). Some acceptable
						errors are: "emf user already exists" and "plpgsql already exists".
						</p> 

						<p>One unacceptable error that could happen during this step is: 
							<div class="pre">createdb: The database creation failed: ERROR: encoding UTF8
							does not match server's locale...
							</div>
						</p>

						<p>If this should occur, then your postgres data directory was not created using the
						proper character encoding.  To address this, you should first stop the Postgres server
						(using your startup script - e.g., /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3 stop), then remove everything
						under the Postgres data directory ($PG_DATA). NOTE: if you have anything in that
						directory custom to your installation, you should back this up first. Next, do these steps:
							<div class="pre">su postgres /usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/bin/initdb --locale=POSIX -D /<i>data</i>/pgsql_data</div>
						</p>
						
						<p>Next, install the EMF version of the postgresql.conf, restart your server, and test your 
						configuration as described in <a href="./third_party_install.html#postgres">Postgres Post-Installation Configuration</a>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Edit the script SetupPostGIS.sh. Modify the two settings shown below to indicate (a)
						the path to the setup script and (b) the root directory for Postgres:
							<div class="pre">export PSQLSCRIPTSDIR=/home/azubrow/emf_installation_beta/db</div>
							<div class="pre">export POSTGRESDIR=/usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3</div>
						</p>
						<p>Double check that the following two PostGIS scripts exist in the $POSTGISSCRIPTSDIR:
						<em>lwpostgis.sql</em> and <em>spatial_ref_sys.sql</em>. If not, modify that path to
						the location of these scripts. If they are not under the default location, check under
						the <em>contrib</em> directory.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Run the PostGIS script. Redirect the output to a log file:
							<div class="pre">$ ./SetupPostGIS.sh &gt;&amp; log.postgis</div>
						</p>
						<p>Check for errors in the log (i.e., log.postgis in the example here).</p>
					</li>									
				</ol>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Testing the EMF database setup and configuring properties:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Start pgadmin3:
							<div class="pre">$ /usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/pgadmin3/bin/pgadmin3 &amp;</div>
						</p>
					</li>				
					<li>
						<p>Log into the local server by double-clicking on it (you should have already setup a
						new server via pgadmin3 in the section <a href="./third_party_install.html#postgres">Connecting
						to Database</a>).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Open the EMF database by clicking on the "+" sign to expand the subcomponents of
						the database. Expand the Schemas which should reveal five schemas: cases, emf,
						emissions, public, and reference. You can continue to burrow down until you actually
						see the data tables. For example: EMF &#8658; Schemas &#8658; emf &#8658; Tables &#8658;
						properties. To see the actual data within a particular table, highlight the name and
						click on the <b>View the data</b> button. This will create a new window for the data
						table.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Review the properties table values. You can expand a column by clicking and dragging
						on the boundary between the columns. You can edit a cell by clicking on the cell and
						typing in it. When you are done, click on another cell. You may need to click save or
						refresh for the change to be registered with the database. Modify the table for your
						system. Specifically, we will change the temporary directory for postgres' imports and
						exports and we will want to check the postgres bin directory:
							<div class="pre">ImportExportTempDir = /data2/tmp</div>
							<div class="pre">postgres-bin-dir = /usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3</div>
						</p>
						<p>Note, if you change these paths after starting the EMF web server (next section),
						you will need to restart tomcat for the new values to be used by the EMF server.

		<h2 id="client">Install EMF Client</h2>
		<p>The EMF Client is the user interface to the EMF system. Typically users run
		the EMF Client from their own desktop or laptop computers (neither the
		EMFServer nor the SMOKEServer). The EMF Client should be run using Java
		6. Before installing the EMF client, download and install the latest <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">
		Java Runtime Environment 6</a> (e.g. JRE 6u16) onto the computer(s) that will run the EMF Client.
		</p>
		
		<p>If you want to use the Analysis Engine, for greater plotting and graphics capabilities, you
		will also need to install <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and modify your EMF batch
		script (for Windows) or your shell script (for Linux or Mac) to point to the location of your R
		installation.
		</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h4>Windows Installation:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Download the <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/emf/install/emfinst.exe">EMF Installer Executable (emfinst.exe)</a>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Double-click on the <em>emfinst.exe</em> to run the installer. The default location for the installer program is <span class="pre">C:\emfinst</span> (note, this is not the EMF client). Once the expansion of the installer program is complete, it will start.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>In the <em>EMF Client Installer</em> window, fill in the fields. You may click the <b>Browse</b>
						button to help you choose any local directories. (NOTE: the input and
						output file directories are the default directories on the remote
						EMFServer, not on your local client's machine. The installer will warn
						you if they don't exist on your client machine, you can ignore these
						warnings). You will likely not need to modify the "Client Home
						Directory". The "Server Address" is your new EMFServer URL or IP
						address. The "EMF Download URL" is the download location for the client
						files (use the exact value below). Example settings:
							<ul>
								<li><b>EMF Download URL</b>: http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/emf/beta_testing/install</li>
								<li><b>Java Home Directory</b>: C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_16</li>

								<li><b>Output File Directory</b>: /data4/smoke</li>
								<li><b>Client Home Directory</b>: C:\Program Files\EMFClient</li>
								<li><b>Server Address</b>: http://EMFServer.unc.edu:8080/emf/services</li>
							</ul>						
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Click the <b>Install</b> button.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>If you already have the client installed, you will be prompted whether you wish to <em>Update</em> or <em>Reinstall</em>. <em>Update</em> will download only changed files, and <em>Reinstall</em> will download a clean client with all the files. In most cases, you can simply <em>Update</em>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>When the installation is finished, click the <b>Done</b> button.</p>
					</li>				
				</ol>
				
				<p><b>Note</b>: A file containing your EMF preferences called <em>EMFPrefs.txt</em> is stored in your user home directory (usually <em>C:\Documents and Settings\<your_username></your_username></em>), and a file containing the installer's preferences called <em>EMFUserInstallPrefs.ini</em> is in the same directory.</p>

						series of zip files. Unzip one or more of the sector-specific
						inventories. After you have unzipped your inventories. Check that the
						files have &#8216;r&#8217; permission and directories have 'rx' permissions for the
						emiss group. Remember, the emf user will need to access these files.
					</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Startup the EMF client and login.  Go to the <b>Manage</b> menu and select <b>Datasets</b>.  This will bring up the <em>Dataset Manager</em> window.</p>
					</li> 
					<li>
						<p>To import a nonpoint inventory, from the <b>Show Datasets of Type</b>
						pull-down, select the dataset type "ORL Nonpoint Inventory (ARINV)".
						The window will continue to be empty because you have not loaded any
						datasets of this type. Click the <b>Import</b> button.  A new <em>Import Datasets</em> window will appear.  Click the <b>Browse</b> button.  Select the nonpoint inventory that you want to import.  After clicking the <b>OK</b> button, you will return to the main <em>Import Datasets</em> window.  <b>For these examples, don't change the default name</b>
						(this is because we need identical names as the EPA names used in our
						example SMOKE case to be provided later). When you import your own
						inventories, you can modify the name as you wish. The EMF dataset names
						are used when writing out the SMOKE input files to disk, but a date and
						version label are appended to the dataset names. To avoid confusion,
						your dataset names should not include date or version information in
						the name &#8211; such information is best inserted in the header of the
						dataset, which can be set in the <b>Description</b> field of the <b>Summary</b> tab
						of the dataset.
						</p>
						<p>Click the <b>Import</b> button. You can monitor the progress of the import in the
						separate <em>Status</em> window. To get the latest information from the server,
						click the <b>Refresh</b> button on the <em>Status</em> window.  After the import
						has completed, you can click the <b>Done</b> button if you are finished with your
						imports, or you could leave the window open for more imports.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>If you want to import multiple datasets at the same time (reduces
						monotonous point-click for each dataset), follow the same steps as
						above. The only differences are that you will select multiple datasets
						from the selection window and that you should check the box to <b>Create
						Multiple Datasets</b> in the <em>Import Datasets</em> window. With this
						option, each file will be imported to a separate
						dataset using the default name derived from the file name. You can only
						use this feature to import datasets of the <b>same Dataset Types</b>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Return to the <em>Dataset Manager</em> window.  Click the <b>Refresh</b>
						button to see your new dataset(s). You will notice that the default
						name strips off the filename's "arinv_" prefix and "_orl.txt" suffix.
						Those will be reinserted by the EMF when exporting the files to disk
						for a SMOKE run.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>To open a dataset, select it and click the <b>View</b> button.  This will
						bring up a new window, <em>Dataset Properties View</em>.
						This has a series of tabs that describe various aspects of the dataset
						including metadata, revisions, and the actual data. To see the actual
						data in the dataset, select the <b>Data</b> tab. If there were
						multiple versions of the dataset, you would then select the version you
						were interested in. Then click the <b>View</b> button.  A new <em>Data Viewer</em>
						window will appear. When you are finished exploring, click the <b>Close</b> button.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Continue importing datasets of type ORL Nonpoint Inventory or switch to another dataset
						type from the <em>Dataset Manager</em> and start to import the new type of data (see table,
						to be provided separately).
						</p>
						
						<p>The EMF will allow one import or two exports to occur simultaneously to
						avoid memory logjams. For example, if you select a large number of
						imports, they will be done sequentially. Similarly, if you export a
						whole series of datasets, they will be exported two at a time. In other
						words, during an import or export, the other imports and exports are
						put on hold until each are completed.
						</p>
						<p>The onroad and nonroad 2005 datasets are very large, in part because of the HAP
						datasets. Even if you do not intend to use the HAP data in your work,
						you should keep them in the database until you can test the EPA SMOKE
						Case in Phase 2.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>To export a dataset, select the dataset from the <em>Dataset Manager</em> window.
						Click the <b>Export</b> button. From the <em>Export</em> window, click the <b>Browse</b>
						button and navigate to your export directory. After you have selected your directory,
						click the <b>Export</b> button.  You can monitor the export in the <em>Status</em>
						window. It is not necessary to do this step manually when you actually
						run SMOKE (the exports are automatic), so this step is here only for
						you to experiment with the EMF.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>After the export is finished, log into your EMFServer or SMOKEServer (via ssh
						or putty) and go to the export directory to view the exported dataset.
						You will notice that the prefix "arinv_" (for ORL Nonpoint Inventory
						dataset type) will have been added to the name. You will also see a new
						suffix. This suffix consists of the date of last modification of the
						dataset (specifically, the modification of that version), the version,
						and the extension "_orl.txt". For example:
							<div class="pre">arinv_pfc_2002_caphap_09mar2009_v0_orl.txt</div>

			<h4>Checks and Errors:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Check to see that the system is cleaning up temporary files. When the EMF
						imports/exports an ORL type dataset, two temporary files are created in
						the temporary directory specified in your properties table (e.g., <span class="pre">/data2/tmp</span>).
						After the import or export finishes, those files should be removed. If
						they are not removed, the likely problem is that you don't have your
						permissions set correctly on the temporary directory or the umask for
						the postgres user is incorrect. One of the temporary files will be
						owned by postgres and should be 'rw' by the emiss group.
