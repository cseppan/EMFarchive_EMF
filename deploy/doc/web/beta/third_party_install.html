		<div class="section">
			<p>This page will walk you through the installation of the Emissions Modeling Framework (EMF) 3rd party software.</p>
			<p>For the following instructions, we will refer to the server which runs the EMF database as the
			"EMFServer"<a href="#note1">1</a> and the server or cluster that runs SMOKE as the "SMOKEServer".
			Although the EMFServer and the SMOKEServer could be the same computer, we strongly recommend that
			they are two different systems. To simplify the instructions, we will give example installation
			paths, user names, and Unix group names. In your installation, you may choose different installation
			paths, user and group names, and passwords than explained below. If something must match these instructions
			exactly, it will be noted in the text.</p>
			<p>Many of the following Unix commands will likely need to be executed while logged in as &#8220;root&#8221; or using the
			&#8220;sudo&#8221; command (depending on your system and your installation location).

		<h2 id="permissions">Users and User Permissions</h2>
		<div class="section">
			<p>An aspect of the EMF system that often causes problems in a new installation is the subtle 
			interaction of three different Unix accounts and the necessary permissions for this interaction
			to work correctly. The three accounts (i.e., Unix user names) are postgres, the owner of the 
			tomcat process (e.g., &#8220;emf&#8221;), and the accounts for those running SMOKE. For this
			interaction to work correctly, the three accounts often need to read and sometimes write within
			the same directories.
			</p>
			<h4>Complete the following steps:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<ol>
					<li>Create a group (or use an existing group), such as &#8220;emiss&#8221;, on both the
					EMFServer and the SMOKEServer. You will want the emiss group to have the same GID on both
					systems (check your system before selecting a GID):
					
					<div class="pre"># addgroup --system --gid 300 emiss</div>

					<p>If <span class="pre">addgroup</span> is not available, alternatively use:</p>
						<div class="pre"># groupadd -r -g 300 emiss</div>

					</li>
					<li>Create a new user, &#8220;emf&#8221;, on both the EMFServer and the SMOKEServer. For
					ease of communication with EMF support, we recommend using this exact user name. Make the
					emf user&#8217;s default group emiss. Ideally, you will want your SMOKE user(s) to use the
					emiss group as their default group as well. You will want the emf user to have the same
					UID on both systems (check your systems before selecting a UID):
						<div class="pre"># adduser --no-create-home --ingroup emiss --UID 1030 emf</div>
					        
					    <p>Likewise, if <span class="pre">adduser</span> is not available, alternatively use:</p>
						
						<div class="pre"># useradd -M -g 1030 emf</div>
					</li>
				</ol>

		<h2 id="java">Java Details</h2>
		<div class="section">
			<p>If you do not already have it installed on your servers, download the latest
			<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" target="_blank">Java Runtime Environment 6</a>
			(e.g., JRE 6u14) for your system. Typically, you will want to get the non-rpm download for your system.
			Ideally, you will want to place the same version of Java in the same location on both your EMFServer and
			your SMOKEServer. In the example below, this location is /user/local/java.</p>

			<div class="pre"># mkdir /usr/local/java</div>
			<div class="pre"># cp jre-6u14-linux-i586.bin /usr/local/java</div>
			<div class="pre"># cd /usr/local/java</div>
			<div class="pre"># chmod u+x jre-6u14-linux-i586.bin</div>
			<div class="pre"># ./jre-6u14-linux-i586.bin</div>

			<p>This will unpack the java bin and libraries under the directory, /usr/local/java /jre.6.0_14.
			Note, if you already have JRE 6.x, you do not need to do this step.

		<h2 id="tomcat">Tomcat Details</h2>
		<div class="section">
	
			<h4>Installing Tomcat:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<p>For installation of Tomcat 6.0, perform the following steps:</p>
	
				<ol>
					<li>Download the latest version of <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_blank">Tomcat 6.0</a>,
					specifically the Core tar file. Extract the Tomcat 6.0 download into your desired directory.
					We recommend <em>/usr/local</em>:
						<div class="pre"># tar xvzf apache-tomcat-6.0.20.tar.gz</div>
					</li>
					<li>Within the Tomcat directory, edit the file <em>conf/tomcat-users.xml</em>, add the following line
					within the <tomcat-users> xml block but not within the comment field (note the password can be changed):					
						<div class="pre">&lt;user username="admin" password="admin" roles="admin,manager"/&gt;</div>
					</li>
					<li>Download the <a href="http://jdbc.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgres JDBC 4 jar</a>
					(for PostgreSQL 8.3) and copy the jar file into Tomcat's <em>lib</em> directory.
					</li>
					<li>Change the owner and group permissions of the apache-tomcat directory to the emf user and emiss 
					group (or whatever group you chose above). Note, in this configuration, the emf user will own all files created by the
					apache-tomcat server:
						<div class="pre"># chown -R emf:emiss /usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.20</div>
					</li>
					<li>Download <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/emf/beta_testing/tomcat_user" target="_blank">our
					Tomcat startup script</a>. You may need to modify the script so that TOMCAT_USER, CATALINA_HOME,
					and JAVA_HOME match your system. Copy the file to /etc/init.d/tomcat
					and make it executable:
						<div class="pre"># chmod u+x  /etc/init.d/tomcat</div>
					</li>				
					<li>Start tomcat:
						<div class="pre"># /etc/init.d/tomcat start</div>
					</li>
				</ol>
	
				<p>The startup script will echo to your screen the values for both CATALINA_HOME and JRE_HOME.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Testing Tomcat:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<ol>
					<li>First, see if the apache is running and owned by the emf user, using the command:
						<div class="pre"># ps aux|grep apache</div>
						
						<p>If the tomcat server doesn't start, look at the logs under, <em>/usr/local/apache-tomcat-6.0.20/logs/catalina.out</em>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Second, try connecting via a web browser from the EMFServer.  Go to the following URL via a web browser to access tomcat:
						<div class="pre">http://localhost:8080</div>
						
						<p>If you can connect, click on "Tomcat Manager" and give your admin username and password to access the web application manager.</p>
					</li>
					<li>Third, try connecting from a web browser on another machine.  Use the URL or IP address of the EMFServer to connect:
						<div class="pre">http://<em>&lt;EMF Server URL&gt;</em>:8080</div>
	
						<p>If you are not able to connect from a remote web browser, your Linux administrator may
						need to open port 8080 in the EMFServer system firewall for the server to accept connections
						from remote clients.
						</p>	
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Starting and Stopping Tomcat:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<p>If the startup script is working properly, you will likely want it to automatically start on reboot
				of your EMFServer. Depending on your system, you might use update-rc.d or chkconfig to add the script to
				your startup process.
				</p>
				<p>There may be situations in which you want to restart tomcat.  To stop tomcat:
					<div class="pre"># /etc/init.d/tomcat stop</div>
				</p>
				
				<p>At times, this does not actually stop the process, so we recommend that you check for the process:
					<div class="pre"># ps aux|grep apache</div>
				</p>
				<p>If the process is still there, kill it by hand.  After this process has finished, start tomcat again.</p>

		<h2 id="postgres">PostgreSQL Details</h2>
		<div class="section">
			<p>Install <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL 8.3</a>.
			We will be using PostgreSQL 8.3.x, which is a fairly current version, but not the latest release.
			There are multiple installation approaches. We will go through a pre-built binary approach in detail. Other
			approaches are discussed later in this document.
			</p> 
	
			<p>A key decision that you need to make prior to installing Postgres is the location of your
			data directory for the postgres database (this is where the inventories and other data will be
			stored within the database). We recommend installing the data directory in a location where it
			can grow to store your inventory data and SMOKE output reports, but not model-ready emissions.
			Ideally, this should be on fast disc, with sufficient size, connected directly to the EMFServer.
			For best performance, the database directory should be on a different disc than the input 
			directory for SMOKE (this latter directory is where the EMF will export files from the database
			for SMOKE to run).
			</p>
			
			<h4>Create a Postgres User:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<p>If you already have postgres running or you are installing it through a package management
				system, you probably do not need to create this user. If you are installing via the pre-built
				binary, you should create it before running the installation. Create a postgres user in which
				the default group is emiss:
				
					<div class="pre"># adduser --ingroup emiss postgres</div>
				</p>
				
				<p>If <span class="pre">adduser</span> is not available, alternatively use:
                	<div class="pre"># useradd -g emiss postgres</div>
				</p>
				
				<p>This user name is a requirement. Setup the postgres user to give r/w permissions to the
				emiss group. This is necessary because during the exporting of large inventories, postgres
				will create a temporary file that the emf user needs to later remove. Add to postgres'
				.bashrc, the following umask line:
				
					<div class="pre">umask 002</div>
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Pre-Built Binary Installation:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<p>From the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> page, go to
				"Downloads". Under "3rd party distributions", click on "Postgres Plus". This will redirect
				you to the EnterpriseDB web page. Select the 8.3.x version of Postgres Plus that is appropriate
				for you system. Extract the tar file on your EMFServer (note, the installation wizard will
				install postgres in another location). Run the bin file to start the installation wizard.
				</p>
				<p>As you step through the installation wizard, you will go through the following steps:
					<ul>
						<li>Choose the install components: select default, both Database Server and Develop/Client Tools</li>
						<li>Value Added Services: leave both items unchecked</li>
						<li>Choose Install Folder: <em>/usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3</em></li>
						<li>Select operating system user: postgres</li>
						<li>Configure your database server: set your data directory (e.g., <em>/data/pgsql_data</em>)</li>
						<li>Configuration Options: leave default port (5432) and have postgres run on system startup</li>
						<li>Enter DBA password: leave database super-user as "postgres", enter password</li>
						<li>Pre-Installation Summary: review and click "Install"</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p>After "Install Complete", click "Done".</p>
				<p>If you make a mistake and decide to uninstall Postgres, there is a user-friendly script under <em>/usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/uninstall</em>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Other installation approaches: Source, Package Management, or Existing Installation:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<p>If for some reason the pre-built binary installation is not sufficient and you decide to
				install PostgreSQL 8.3.x from source, through your package management system, or you already
				have an existing setup, the following considerations should prepare your system for working with
				the EMF. If you already have PostgreSQL 8.3 installed, we highly recommend that you backup your
				database and stop your server before proceeding with any changes.
				</p>
				
				<p>Your version of PostgreSQL needs to have been built with the tcl server-side language (i.e.,
				configuration flag '--with-tcl'). You will also want to install the following contrib. packages:
				adminpack and tablefunc. For more details on this build option and the contrib packages, see the documentation
				for PostgreSQL 8.3 and/or your package management documentation. To see which contrib. packages are
				already installed, check the followingdirectory: <em>/usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/share/contrib</em>.
				</p>
				
				<p>Install <a href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">PostGIS 1.3.x</a>, the GIS extension to PostgreSQL.
				Before going through the installation of the contrib package, make sure that the following prerequisites have
				been installed: <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/" target="_blank">GEOS</a> (v3.0 or higher) and
				<a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/" target="_blank">PROJ.4</a> (v4.5 or higher). Note, if you have
				installed through the pre-built	binary approach above, you will automatically install Postgis.
				</p>
				
				<p>If you are interested in having a GUI for managing the database directly, install
				<a href="http://www.pgadmin.org/" target="_blank">pgadminIII</a>. Note, you will need to have added the
				contrib package adminpack before using pgadminIII. Note, if you have installed through the pre-built
				binary approach above, you will automatically install pgadminIII.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h4>Connecting to Database:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<p>The first time you try to connect to the database, you should connect from
				the EMFServer. To connect via pgadminIII, start the program from either	the application menu or from the
				command line:
					<div class="pre"># /usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/pgadmin3/bin/pgadmin3 &amp;</div>
				</p>

				<p>In the new pgadmin3 window, go to the "File" menu and click "Add Server": 
					<ul>
						<li>Name: pgsql_local (or some other name that indicates the server)</li>
						<li>Host: localhost</li>
						<li>Port: 5432</li>
						<li>Maintenance DB: postgres</li>
						<li>Username: postgres</li>
						<li>Password:  (this is your database user's password)</li>
						<li>Store password:  uncheck</li>
						<li>Remaining options: leave as default</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>After connecting to the server, you will see a list of available databases in the Object Browser panel
				on the left side of the window. You can click on the plus sign next to any database to see the schemas,
				tables, and	other objects available within each database.
				</p>
                
                <p>It is possible to run PGAdminIII from a remote computer (e.g., a Windows machine) to connect to the Postgres
                server.  To do this, install PGAdminIII on the computer of interest and use the Add server file menu to create
                a link to the Postgres server you are trying to access.  On the EMF server machine, you need to give the 
				remote computer permission to access the database by adding a line to the pg_hba.conf file in the Postgres data
				directory.  If you wish to allow all IP addresses starting with 10.123 to connect, the line will look something like:
					<div class="pre"> host all all 10.123.0.0/16 md5</div>
					
				<p>Alternatively, you can list specific IP addresses by specifying the IP address/32, or three-tier IP addresses by
				specifying the IP address as 10.123.456.0/24.  Please see the Postgres documentation for more information on
				the pg_hba.conf file.
				</p>
			</div>
					
			<h4>Post-Installation Configuration:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<p>The final step is to configure the PostgreSQL server for the installation of the EMF server:
					</p><ol>
						<li>Download <a href="http://www.ie.unc.edu/cempd/projects/emf/beta_testing/postgresql.conf">the example postgresql.conf</a>.
							You will want to modify the listen_address line to the IP address of your EMFServer:
							<div class="pre">listen_addresses = 'localhost,152.2.76.31'</div>
						</li>
						<li>The rest of the configuration has been tuned for the EPA's server. If you find that the Postgres
						server is not performing up to expectations, you might want to modify the shared_buffers value. If
						you decide to modify other parameters, we recommend that you consult the PostgreSQL server configuration
						instructions.
						</li>
						<li>After you have edited your local copy of this file, copy the configuration file to the postgres
						data directory. Note, you will need to log in as the postgres user (Linux user) to modify these files:
							<div class="pre"># su postgres</div>
							<div class="pre"># cd /data/pgsql_data</div>
							<div class="pre"># cp <em>&lt;path to config file&gt;</em>/postgresql.conf .</div>
						</li>
						<li>While logged in as the postgres user, you should also modify the pg_hba.conf. Edit the file
						to reduce the level of security when accessing the database from the localhost (i.e. turn off passwords):
							<div class="pre">local	all		postgres	trust</div>
							<div class="pre">local 	all		all			trust</div>
							
							<p>This will reduce the number of passwords you will have to type during the EMF setup.
							After the database has been populated with the EMF data, you can change the restrictions back to a
							more strict configuration.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>Restart the postgres server for the above changes to be loaded into the system:
							<div class="pre"># /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.3 restart</div>
							
							<p>Note for PostgreSQL installed through Postgres Plus, the startup script may be called "pgplus_83".</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				<p></p>
			</div>

			<h4>Verifying that your Database Server is Running</h4>
				<div class="section">
                	<p>Before proceeding further, ensure that your database server process
					started successfully.  To show the postgres related processes, use the command:

						<div class="pre">ps -elf | grep postg</div>

					If you find that there are some postgres processes listed, then your server is running 
					properly and move on to the next section.  <b>If there are no postgres processes, then your
					server did not start properly</b>.  To determine the reason for the database server
					not starting, review the contents of the server log file under the Postgres data directory.  It might be
					called <span class="pre">serverlog</span>, or it may be in a <span class="pre">pg_log</span> subdirectory and called something like
					<em>postgresql-20090828_131710.log</em>.  If the server log file contains an error like:
						<div class="pre">
							FATAL:  could not create shared memory segment: Invalid argument<br/>
							DETAIL:  Failed system call was shmget(key=5432001, size=86466560, 03600).<br/>
							HINT:  This error usually means that PostgreSQL's request for a shared memory segment<br/>
							exceeded your kernel's SHMMAX parameter.  You can either reduce the request size or<br/>
							reconfigure the kernel with larger SHMMAX.  To reduce the request size<br/>
							(currently 86466560 bytes), reduce PostgreSQL's shared_buffers parameter<br/>
							(currently 4096) and/or its max_connections parameter (currently 200).<br/>
						</div>

					then the server will not start because your system is preventing postgres from declaring 
					a shared memory segment of the size specified in the shared_buffers parameter of your 
					postgresql.conf file.  Instructions for updating this system setting on some types of servers
					are available from <a href=http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/database/RHDB-2.1-Manual/admin_user/kernel-resources.html>http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/database/RHDB-2.1-Manual/admin_user/kernel-resources.html</a>.
					</p>
				</div>
			<h4>Testing Tcl Procedural Language:</h4>
			<div class="section">
				<p>The pltcl procedural language is required for the EMF:
					<ol>
						<li>Check that you have the package <em>Tcl 8.4</em> on your system (via your package management system).</li>
						<li>Test if you can create a new procedural language (pltcl) in the postgres database as the user <em>postgres</em>:
							<div class="pre">$ /usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/bin/createlang -U postgres -d postgres pltcl</div>
						</li>
						<li>If this fails with a similar error message:
							<div class="pre">ERROR: could not load library "/usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/lib/postgresql/pltcl.so": libtcl8.4.so:
							cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</div>
							
							<p>The problem is that the libtcl8.4.so likely has a different name. Make a
							link in Postgres' lib directory to the Tcl library on your system, eg:
								<div class="pre"># ln -s /usr/lib/libtcl8.4.so.0  /usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/lib/libtcl8.4.so</div>
							</p>
							<p>Rerun your test of adding the language.</p>
						</li>
						<li>Test if the language has been loaded:
							<div class="pre">$ /usr/local/PostgreSQL/8.3/bin/createlang -l -U postgres -d postgres</div>
						</li>
					</ol>
				<p></p>
