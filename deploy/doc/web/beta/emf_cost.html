			<h4>Complete the following steps:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Download the CoST supporting training tar file, control_strategy_training.tar.gz, and
					the training manual, "CoST_UsersGuide_&lt;data&gt;.doc" from the EPA's ftp site:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>FTP address</b>: scienceftp.epa.gov</li>
						<li><b>login</b>: emfbeta</li>
						<li><b>password</b>: 4aXqKhhu</li>
					</ul>
					<p/>											
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Untar the control_strategy_training.tar.gz file directory to your import directory
					defined previously:
						<div class="pre">$ tar xvzf control_strategy_training.tar.gz</div>	
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>After you have untarred the supporting files, verify that the files have 'r' ('read') permissions
					and directories have 'rx' ('read-execute') permissions for the "emiss" group. Remember that the "emf"
					user will need to access these files.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Start the EMF client and login. Go to the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>Import</b>. This will
					bring up the "Import Datasets" window. Import the following datasets using the dataset type, name
					and file listed below.
					</p>
					<p><i>Note</i>: The dataset name (which is case-sensitive) and the dataset type must be the same as
					listed in the table in order for the CoST training setup to work correctly. If you make a mistake
					in the name, you can click the <b>Edit Properties</b> button from the "Dataset Manager: window and modify the name.
					</p>				
				
					<table border="1">
						<tr><th>File Name</th><th>Dataset Type</th><th>Dataset Name</th></tr>
						<tr><td>control_strategy_training/inventories/ptnonipm/ptinv_ptnonipm_2020cc_22jun2009_v0_limited_orl.txt</td><td>ORL Point Inventory (PTINV)</td><td>ptnonipm_2020cc</td></tr>

					</table>			
					<p/>											
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>(<i>Note</i>: For this next step, importing control measures, you must have administrative privileges.
					If your EMF user does not have these privileges, log out and re-login as a user who does have administrative\
					privileges.)
					</p>
					<p>From the EMF client, go to the <b>Manage</b> menu and select <b>Control Measures</b>. This will bring up
					the "Control Measure Manager" window. Click the <b>Import</b> button to bring up the "Import Control Measures" window.
					Click the <b>Browse</b> button and select the following files from the <span class="pre">control_strategy_training/control_measures</span>
					directory to import area control measures:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>CoST_CM_DB_Area_Sources_v.5.2 27_Sep_2007_Summary.csv</li>
						<li>CoST_CM_DB_Area_Sources_v.5.2 27_Sep_2007_Efficiency.csv</li>
						<li>CoST_CM_DB_Area_Sources_v.5.2 27_Sep_2007_SCC.csv</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Click the <b>Import</b> button. You can click the <b>Import Status</b> button every so often to see
					the current status of the import process. The import is complete when the message "Completed importing
					control measures" is displayed. Close the <i>Import Control Measures</i> window by clicking the <b>Done</b>
					button.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Repeat the process from the previous step and import the point measures using the following files:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>CoST_CM_DB_Point_v.5.3_Summary.csv</li>
						<li>CoST_CM_DB_Point_v.5.3_Eff.csv</li>
						<li>CoST_CM_DB_Point_v.5.3_Equation.csv</li>
						<li>CoST_CM_DB_Point_v.5.3_SCC.csv</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>From the control_strategy_training directory, run the following command from the
					command prompt (you may need to use the full path to psql):
						<div class="pre">psql -d EMF -U emf -f setup_training_strategies.sql</div>	
					</p>
					<p>If the script executes successfully, the following message will be in STDOUT: "The training control
					strategies have been successfully installed". If the success message is not in STDOUT, then look for
					errors (look for "ERROR" message) in STDOUT. Any errors received will most likely be due to not importing
					all the correct datasets listed in Step 4. Evaluate the error message to determine which datasets still
					need to be imported.
					</p>				
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The control strategy training support data has now been installed so that users will be able
					to follow the training exercises. To ensure that the new example control strategies were properly
					installed, go the <b>Manage</b> menu and select <b>Control Strategies</b>. This will bring up the
					<i>Control Strategy Manager</i> window. Three example strategies should have been loaded into your
					EMF system:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Maximum Emissions Reduction Example</li>
						<li>Least Cost Example</li>
						<li>Apply Measure In Series Example</li>
					</ul>
					<p>See the <b>Control Strategy Tool (CoST) Training Manual and User's Guide</b> for the training exercises.
					For the <i>Advanced Exercises</i> in the user's guide, please utilize one of the ORL inventories that were
					supplied with the 2005 emissions platform tar file, as opposed to the one listed in the exercise.
					</p>
